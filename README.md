# Worldspace Health Bars

Learn how to implement Worldspace Health Bars in this tutorial repository with [accompanying video tutorial](https://youtu.be/cUQVLgohAjY).

A common issue if you use Sprites is they don't stretch well or have the same capabilities like you have with the UI Canvas. 
We'll use a Worldspace Canvas and a couple small scripts to make a Health Bar that follows a particular target.

This tutorial is using some concepts demonstrated in other tutorials. If you need more explanation on some topics that are skipped over in this video consider checking out the original tutorial covering those topics:
1. [Explosions with Obstructions](https://youtu.be/ZoyFL8tH0SU)
2. [Placing NavMeshAgents on a NavMesh at Runtime](https://youtu.be/5uO0dXYbL-s)
3. [Introduction to NavMeshes in Unity](https://youtu.be/aHFSDcEQuzQ)
3. [Progress Bars](https://youtu.be/Qw8odLHv38Q)

Each of these comes with a tutorial repository like this one so you can inspect the scene setup and review the code at your own pace.
